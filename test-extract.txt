Building on this initial picture from \citet{richards_copula}, I show in what follows that the behavior of \textit{maging}%
% Footnote
\footnote{\label{fn:become}%
  \citet{richards_copula} provides an analysis of \textit{maging} as the overt infinitival form of the Tagalog copula whose form in matrix contexts is \textit{\O}.
  I follow \citeauthor{richards_copula} in glossing \textit{maging} as `be', but the discussion in this section should be agnostic to the analysis of this element.
  It also bears pointing out that \textit{maging} is often translated, especially in isolation, as English \textit{become}.
  \citeauthor{richards_copula} ties this \textit{\O}$\sim$\textit{maging} alternation to a broader stative--inchoative alternation in the language.
  As with the control constructions, other potentially significant but tangential datapoints are given in footnotes.}
% /Footnote
follows the same pattern of asymmetry and neutralization presented so far in this section.
I then point other evidence from this environment that supports a view where relativization is the cause for the nominal behavior of some voice phrases (i.e., the headless relatives).

First, I extend \citet{richards_copula} by showing that derived nominals behave like bare nominals and not voice phrases.
This is shown in the pairs of examples below (\ref{ex:gusto-luto}-\ref{ex:gusto-lagay}).
As with bare nominals (\ref{ex:maging-noun}), \textit{maging} is obligatory with derived nominals (\ref{ex:gusto-luto-n}, \ref{ex:gusto-lagay-n}), replicating what we have seen thus far.
Furthermore, notice that the voice phrase examples are not marked with aspect.%

\footnote{%
  Or are marked for some deficient or semantically non-contentful value of aspect.
  For example, \citet{himmelmann2008} refers to this form of the verb as irrealis perfective.}



  Argument \textit{wh}-questions like (\ref{ex:qa-nom}) have been argued to involve pseudocleft structures, where an \textit{ang}-marked \textit{wh}-word appears as a predicate and an \textit{ang}-marked headless relative appears in subject position \citep{paul2001,aldridge2002,potsdam2006}. Work that deals with this issue \citep[e.g.,][]{alexiadou2008,baker.vinokurova2009} usually ties the syntactic height of the nominalizers intimately with the resulting interpretation as well as a number of other properties (e.g., ability to host certain kinds of adverbs, availability of argument structure, etc.).
